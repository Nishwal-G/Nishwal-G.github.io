        <h2>Modelling Bacterial Turbulence with Finite Tumbling</h2>
        <p>
     In this work, we investigate how introducing a finite tumbling duration into models of bacterial swimmers affects the onset of hydrodynamic 
     instabilities, as revealed through changes in the system’s dispersion relations. We treat the population as consisting of runners and tumblers, 
     with stochastic switching between the two states at prescribed rates. This leads to a coupled pair of Smoluchowski equations for the distribution 
     functions of each population, incorporating both translational and rotational dynamics.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
     Unlike the instantaneous reorientation assumed in classic run-and-tumble models, tumblers here undergo active reorientation at a finite angular velocity, 
     while also experiencing the same hydrodynamic couplings as runners. We identify the uniform, isotropic steady state of the system and perform a linear 
     stability analysis about this base state. By projecting perturbations onto monopole, dipole, and quadrupole spherical harmonics, the governing equations reduce to a tractable eigenvalue problem.
        </p>
        <p> 
     This formulation allows us to quantify how finite tumbling modifies the critical parameters for instability onset, alters the growth rates of unstable modes, 
     and changes the relative contributions of hydrodynamic and reorientation mechanisms. The results provide a systematic route to connect microscopic swimmer dynamics 
     with emergent large-scale flow patterns in active suspensions.

        <h2>Hopfield Network and Chromatin memory</h2>
        <p>
            This project explores whether the diverse conformational states emerging from chromatin folding—particularly those associated with transcription 
            factory formation—can act as stable memory states in the cell’s regulatory landscape. Building on the connection between induced phase 
            separation in chromatin and the emergence of transcriptional hubs, we investigate whether these folded states can serve as attractors in a Hopfield network framework. 
            In this analogy, the Waddington landscape is reinterpreted as a network of memory basins, where cellular states are “remembered” and re-established following division. 
            The aim is to bridge physical models of chromatin organization with neural network theory, providing insight into how genome architecture encodes and preserves cellular identity.
