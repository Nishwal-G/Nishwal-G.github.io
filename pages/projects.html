        My research so far deals with quantum magnetism and low‑temperature phenomena. The team I work with at Edinburgh, including <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LDkfAy4AAAAJ&hl=en"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Stock</a> and <a href="https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/people/tiberiu-popescu"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiberiu Popescu</a> 
        is particularly interested in 
        exploring bond‑dependent exchange in frustrated lattices, and in using simulation techniques to connect microscopic spin models with experimental signatures 
        like magnetocaloric effects and neutron scattering spectra. I have also recently started working on in the field of bacterial turbulence with  <a href="https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~amorozov/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Morozov</a>, by trying to integrate 
        the bacterial tumbling process (usually taken to me infinitesimal) as a finite one. Further, I will shortly begin working with <a href="https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~dmarendu/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Davide Marenduzzo</a> on the role of 
        transcirption factories in transcription bursts observed in DNA.

        <h2><a href="../projects/projectOne/projectOne.html">Zeeman Split Kramers Doublets in Spin-Supersolid Candidate Na<sub>2</sub>BaCo(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub></a></h2>

        <p>
            Na<sub>2</sub>BaCo(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a triangular 
            antiferromagnet near a quantum critical point (μ<sub>0</sub>H<sub>c</sub> ≈ 1.6 T), 
            enabling highly efficient adiabatic demagnetization cooling; high-field neutron 
            spectroscopy reveals coupled Zeeman-split Kramers doublets driving ferromagnetic excitations 
            that become overdamped and spatially disordered below μ<sub>0</sub>H<sub>c</sub>, with field-tuned 
            evolution underpinning magnetocaloric effects and highlighting Kramers doublet systems near 
            quantum criticality as promising low-temperature coolants.

        <h2><a href="../projects/projectTwo/projectTwo.html">Understanding Bond-Dependent Exchange in CoTiO<sub>3</sub> (Seniour Honours Project)</a></h2>

        <p>
            This study applies a Green’s function response model to spin-wave excitations in CoTiO<sub>3</sub>, developing a novel mathematical framework 
            incorporating a rotating frame and single-ion Co<sup>2+</sup> physics; findings emphasize strong bond-dependent 
            exchange interactions modeled via Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) theory, with dimer formation proposed as the source of 
            anisotropy, validated by deriving θ<sub>CW</sub> = 17.4 K and constraining exchange and molecular field terms to ~4.0 ± 0.2 meV, 
            highlighting cobaltates like CoTiO<sub>3</sub> as spin-liquid candidates.

        <h2><a href="../projects/projectThree/projectThree.html">Testing the Validity of Kepler’s Third Law</a></h2>
        <p>
            <p> By simulating the Solar System with Newtonian dynamics and the Verlet method, this project determined an optimal time step 
                of 0.5 days, keeping energy fluctuations to just 4.36×10⁻³%. Over 500 simulated years, the model accurately reproduced orbital periods, 
                perihelia, and aphelia, and captured phenomena like Mercury’s apsidal precession. The results confirmed Kepler’s Third Law, even when 
                planetary masses were altered, allowing exploration of how changes in planet sizes affect neighboring orbits.
