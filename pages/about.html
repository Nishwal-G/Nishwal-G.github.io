        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am currently a 5th year Physics Student at the University of Edinburgh, purusing an Integrated Masters undergraudate programme. 
            As can be seen from my research, I am interested mainly in condensed matter physics, both of the soft and hard variety! My specific
            subject interests include statistical physics, quantum solids, fluid mechanics,  and as of recent, the physics of DNA. Words cannot
            express the gratitude that I have for my supervisors Chris Stock, Alexander Morozov and Davide Marenduzzo who have helped me cultivate
            experience in these fields! Of course, my friends who I have discussions with on a daily basis remain as valauable resource as any other
            (They know who they are!).
        </p>
        <p> I’ve been really lucky to have the opportunities I’ve had, thanks in large part to my family. My parents and my sister have always encouraged my 
            curiosity and supported me, both emotionally and financially, and I’m incredibly grateful for the way they’ve fostered my interests and given me 
            the freedom to pursue what I love. 
        </p>
        
        <p> Outside of physics, I’ve always loved solving Rubik’s cubes (up to a 9×9!), playing cricket, swimming at the beach, and writing. Lately, though, those 
            hobbies have taken a bit of a back seat as I’ve become more caught up in physics. These days, instead of writing online about the debt crisis of the 
            Trinidadian economy, I find myself talking more about things like fusion energy or the crisis in cosmology. 
        </p> 
       
        <p> I’m very aware that the chances I’ve had weren’t purely down to me, and I don’t want to waste them. I hope that through my work, even in a 
            small way, I can help build a world where everyone has the opportunity like me to explore who they truly want to be! </p>
