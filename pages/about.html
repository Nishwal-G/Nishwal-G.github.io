        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am currently a 5th year Physics Student at the University of Edinburgh, pursuing an Integrated Masters undergraudate programme. 
            As can be seen from my research, I am interested mainly in condensed matter physics, both of the soft and hard variety! My specific
            subject interests include statistical physics, quantum solids, fluid mechanics, and as of recent, the physics of DNA. Words cannot
            express the gratitude that I have for my supervisors: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LDkfAy4AAAAJ&hl=en">Chris Stock</a>, 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2MydgHoAAAAJ&hl=en">Alexander Morozov</a> and 
           <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OvfzkRoAAAAJ&hl=en">Davide Marenduzzo</a> who have helped me cultivate
            experience in these fields! Of course, my friends who I have discussions with on a daily basis remain as valuable a resource as any other.
        </p>
        <p> I’ve been really lucky to have the opportunities I’ve had, thanks in large part to my family. My parents and my sister have always encouraged my 
            curiosity and supported me - both emotionally and financially - and I’m incredibly grateful for the way they’ve fostered my interests and given me 
            the freedom to pursue what I love. Outside of physics, I’ve always loved playing cricket, solving various Rubik’s cubes, swimming at the beach, 
            and writing. Lately, though, those hobbies have taken a bit of a back seat as I’ve become more caught up in physics. These days, I find myself talking more about things like 
            <a href="https://eusci.org.uk/2024/10/07/fusion-energy-a-viable-alternative-to-fossil-fuels/">fusion energy</a> or 
            the  <a href="https://eusci.org.uk/2024/04/15/crisis-in-cosmology-the-laniakea-supercluster-and-what-it-means-for-the-universe/">crisis in cosmology</a>.
        </p> 
       
       <p> I’m very aware that the chances I’ve had weren’t purely down to me, and I don’t intend to waste them. I know that a world shaped by inequality, war, and countless forms of oppression 
           has denied many people the same freedoms and opportunities I’ve been lucky to enjoy. Yet I believe, as Keats lamented in Lamia, that while philosophy — and by extension, science — may 
           at times “unweave a rainbow,” stripping mystery from the world, it also gives us the tools to see deeper truths and build a clearer understanding of the world around us. 
           It is through physics and science that we can grasp the forces shaping both nature and society, and perhaps find ways to transform the conditions of life itself. 
           Whatever path I follow, I hope that in my own small way, I can contribute to the changes needed so that, as a society, we might move beyond the confines of mere 
           necessity and step into a realm where everyone has the freedom to explore what they love and discover who they truly want to be. 
       </p>
