        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am currently a 5th year Physics Student at the University of Edinburgh, pursuing an Integrated Masters undergraudate programme. 
            As can be seen from my research, I am interested mainly in condensed matter physics, both of the soft and hard variety! My specific
            subject interests include statistical physics, quantum solids, fluid mechanics, and as of recent, the physics of DNA. Words cannot
            express the gratitude that I have for my supervisors: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LDkfAy4AAAAJ&hl=en">Chris Stock</a>, 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2MydgHoAAAAJ&hl=en">Alexander Morozov</a> and 
           <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OvfzkRoAAAAJ&hl=en">Davide Marenduzzo</a> who have helped me cultivate
            experience in these fields! Of course, my friends who I have discussions with on a daily basis remain as valuable a resource as any other.
        </p>
        <p> I’ve been really lucky to have the opportunities I’ve had, thanks in large part to my family. My parents and my sister have always encouraged my 
            curiosity and supported me, both emotionally and financially, and I’m incredibly grateful for the way they’ve fostered my interests and given me 
            the freedom to pursue what I love. Outside of physics, I’ve always loved solving various Rubik’s cubes, playing cricket, swimming at the beach, 
            and writing. Lately, though, those hobbies have taken a bit of a back seat as I’ve become more caught up in physics. These days, instead of writing about 
            the state of the Trinidadian economy, I find myself talking more about things like 
            <a href="https://eusci.org.uk/2024/10/07/fusion-energy-a-viable-alternative-to-fossil-fuels/">fusion energy</a> or 
            the  <a href="https://eusci.org.uk/2024/04/15/crisis-in-cosmology-the-laniakea-supercluster-and-what-it-means-for-the-universe/">crisis in cosmology</a>.
        </p> 
       
        <p> I’m very aware that the chances I’ve had weren’t purely down to me, and I don’t intend to waste them. I know that a world rife with inequality, war, and 
            other forms of oppression has robbed many people of the same freedoms and opportunities I’ve enjoyed. Whatever I do, even in a small way, I hope can help 
            contribute to building a world where everyone has the chance, like me, to explore what they love and discover who they truly want to be. 
        </p>
