        <h2>Some Words</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am currently a 5th year Physics Student at the University of Edinburgh, pursuing an Integrated Masters undergraduate programme. 
            As can be seen from my research, I am interested mainly in condensed matter physics, both of the soft and hard variety! My specific
            subject interests include statistical physics, quantum solids, fluid mechanics, and as of recent, the physics of DNA. Currently, I study the
            effects of a finite tumbling mechanism in bacteria and also I'm trying to understand the nature of transcription bursts in DNA. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Words cannot express the gratitude that I have for my supervisors: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LDkfAy4AAAAJ&hl=en"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Stock</a>, 
            <a href="https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~amorozov/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexander Morozov</a> and 
           <a href="https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~dmarendu/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Davide Marenduzzo</a> who have helped me cultivate
            experience in these fields! Of course, my friends who I have discussions with on a daily basis remain as valuable a resource as any other.
        </p>
        <p> However, I'd like to think I am more than my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ka6DBeQAAAAJ&hl=en"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Scholar</a> page.
            I’ve been really lucky to have the opportunities I’ve had, thanks in large part to <a href="https://trinidadexpress.com/news/local/life-love-and-a-passion-for-medicine/article_37bcdf83-9343-51a0-b240-f275fa7c79c9.html"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my family</a>. 
            My parents and my sister have always encouraged my 
            curiosity and supported me — both emotionally and financially — and I’m incredibly grateful for the way they’ve fostered my interests and given me 
            the freedom to pursue what I love. Outside of physics, I’ve always loved playing cricket, attempting to get better at chess, solving various Rubik’s cubes, swimming at the beach, 
            and writing. Lately, though, those hobbies have taken a bit of a back seat as I’ve become more caught up in physics. These days, I find myself talking more about things like 
            <a href="https://eusci.org.uk/2024/10/07/fusion-energy-a-viable-alternative-to-fossil-fuels/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fusion energy</a> or 
            the  <a href="https://eusci.org.uk/2024/04/15/crisis-in-cosmology-the-laniakea-supercluster-and-what-it-means-for-the-universe/"target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crisis in cosmology</a>.
        </p> 
       
       <p> I know I’ve been fortunate. I’ve had chances that many people, despite working just as hard, haven’t been given. A world full of poverty, inequality, war, and discrimination has stripped away freedoms 
           and opportunities from others, priviledges that I’ve been lucky to enjoy. Hence, I believe it’s my responsibility to make the most of what I’ve been given. Sometimes I think of how John Keats wrote that philosophy — 
           and, by extension, science — can “unweave a rainbow,” taking some of the magic and mystery out of the world. But it follows that science removes mystery only to reveal deeper and more beautiful truths. 
           For me, science is about using that knowledge to better understand both nature and society, and to help improve life for as many people as possible.
        </p>  
           
         <p>  Whatever path I follow, I hope that in my own small way, I can contribute to the changes needed so that, as a society, we might move beyond the confines of mundane 
           necessity and step into the realm of real freedom, where everyone can explore what they love and discover who they truly want to be, no matter the circumstances of their birth. To recall the quote by 
             Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire which the Trinidadian author C.L.R. James was fond of: "<strong>...there is a place for everyone at the rendezvous of victory</strong>"
